          Our Story
        </h2>
        <p className="text-gray-700">
          Our journey started with a clear goal — to provide strong and
          long-lasting steel furniture tailored to our customers’ needs. We
          started small, focusing on beds and almirahs, and gradually expanded
          to include dining tables, sofa sets, office furniture, and custom
          fabrication projects.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3 text-gray-700">
          Today, we continue to serve with the same honesty and work ethic,
          making quality furniture that supports homes and businesses across the
          region.
